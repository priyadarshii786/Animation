# Animation
<hr>
The "Animation" project is an interactive visualization created with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features an engaging display where a stable center circle serves as the focal point. Surrounding this central circle is another circle that gracefully revolves around it, creating an elegant orbiting effect. Adding to the dynamism, a third circle encircles the second one, creating a mesmerizing triple-revolution animation that captivates the viewer's attention.
